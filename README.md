- Dataset of trash objects for waste classification and detection.

- Contains 17785 waste object images divided into seven classes (glass, plastic, metal, e-waste, cardboard, paper, medical waste).

- Each class is furthur divided into its subclasses as follows:

1. Medical waste : Syringes, Surgical Gloves, Surgical Masks, Medicines( Drugs and Pills)   [Number of images: 2010]
2. E-Waste : Electronic chips, Laptops and Smartphones, Applicances, Electric wires, cords and cables   [Number of images: 2883]
3. Plastic : Bags, Bottles, Containers, Cups, Cigarette Butts (which have a plastic filter)  [Number of images: 2669]
4. Paper : Tetra Pak, News Papers, Paper Cups, Paper Tissues  [Number of images: 2695]
5. Metal : Beverage Cans, Cnostruction Scrap, Spray Cans, Food Grade Cans, Other metal objects. [Number of images: 2586]
6. Glass [Number of images: 2528]
7. Cardboard [Number of images: 2414]
